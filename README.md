## 🇮🇳 Executive Summary

**VeriChain** is a state-of-the-art **Decentralized Verifiable Credential & Digital Identity Platform** tailored for Indian GovTech, Tourism, and Cybersecurity infrastructure.

It bridges the security gap between legacy physical IDs and cloud databases by anchoring **cryptographic hash commitments** onto an EVM-compatible blockchain ledger (**Polygon Amoy Testnet**). VeriChain ensures that **Zero Raw Personally Identifiable Information (PII)** is ever stored on-chain, achieving total compliance with **W3C Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs)** and the **Digital Personal Data Protection (DPDP) Act, 2023**.

```

### 1. **Zero Raw PII Cryptographic Commitments**
- Raw citizen data (Aadhaar, Passport, PAN) remains exclusively with the credential holder.
- Only the deterministic SHA-256 hash digest is committed to the blockchain, making identity forgery mathematically impossible while guaranteeing total privacy.

### 2. **Multi-DID Granular Lifecycle Management**
- Citizens can hold multiple verifiable identities (e.g., National ID, Tourist Pass, Driver Permit).
- Authorities have granular, selective on-chain revocation control (`CREDENTIAL_REVOKED` block transaction) without affecting other valid credentials.
- Real-time categorization: **Active DIDs**, **Revoked DIDs (Authority enforced)**, and **Expired DIDs (Temporal limit passed)**.

### 3. **High-Assurance Hardened Security Stack**
- **Layer-1 Rate Limiting**: Per-IP throttling (30 req/min) prevents automated credential stuffing.
- **Layer-2 Account Lockouts**: 5 consecutive invalid OTP attempts trigger a 15-minute temporary lockout.
- **Anti-Enumeration Safeguards**: Generic error messaging prevents account/email discovery attacks.
- **HTML/XSS Sanitization**: Automated stripping of malicious payloads on all server endpoints.
